===================================================

There is nothing special about these instructions. They are intended as a
step-by-step guide for whoever isn't used to install kernel modules.

It may *look* complicated, but the whole thing should take no more than 10
minutes.

By default, the module is compiled for the kernel currently running.

The installations consists of the following steps:

1. Compilation
2. Move frandom.ko to /system/lib/modules/{something}
3. Make frandom load at bootup
4. Test

In detail:
=========
1. Compile
==========

Simply type "make" at shell prompt. Type "make clean" to clean working directory.

2. Installing to /system/lib/modules
===========================================

Just create /system/lib/modules if none exist and place the newly compile frandom.ko in there, set permissions to 644.

3. Make frandom load at bootup
==============================

This can be done by adding the script named 00frandom into /etc/init.d, provided your kernel supports init.d.

5. Test
=======

The test.sh script runs a simple speed test. It can be executed as regular
user. To excecute, just place test.sh in /sdcard. In Terminal, 
type "cd /sdcard", then "sh test.sh".

Good luck & skill,
